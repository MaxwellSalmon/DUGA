## DUGA Raycaster

DUGA is a raycaster made in Python3 with Pygame. It is a game built on top of a simple engine of the same name. An example of what the Pygame framework is capable of.

## My goal

The goal of DUGA is to create a first-person-shooter with roguelike elements and local multiplayer. At the moment I am working on the roguelike elements.
The local multiplayer will most likely not be added, as I want to work on other projects.
