## DUGA Raycaster

DUGA is a raycaster made in Python3 with Pygame. It is a game built on top of a simple engine of the same name. An example of what the Pygame framework is capable of.

## My goal

Inititally, my goal was to make a first person shooter with roguelike elements and local multiplayer. However, I discarded the multiplayer and kept the other parts.
Now I just want the game to be good and I hope people will enjoy playing it!
